DOMINO GAME

1). Introduction

This is the reproduction of the Domino game as part of my Web Development Bootcamp at IronHack Brazil (Module 1 Project).

2). History of the Game

Domino games call for calculation and strategy and some of them are extremely complex. Dominoes are direct descendants of the ordinary six sided dice, and although a very similar game was played in ancient Egypt, the domino appears to have been invented independently in Europe and China. Where the Chinese have played domino games for several centuries, the European game seems to have originated in Italy as recently as the beginning of the 18th century. It quickly spread throughout Europe and towards the end of the 11th century it was brought to England, probably by French prisoners of war. Since then, domino games have become known throughout most of the world.

3). Definition and Rules of the Game

This game is played by two or four persons, with twenty-eight pieces of oblong ivory, plain at the back, but on the face divided by a black line in the middle, and indented with spots, from one to a double six, which pieces are a double-blank, ace-blank, double-ace, deuce-blank, deuce-ace, double-deuce, trois-blank, trois-ace, trois-deuce, double-trois, four-blank, four-ace, four-deuce, four-trois, double-four, five-blank, five-ace, five-deuce, five-trois, five-four, double-five, six-blank, six-ace, six-deuce, six-trois, six-four, six-five, and double-six. 
Sometimes a double set is played with, of which double twelve is the highest. At the commencement of the game, the dominoes are well mixed, with their faces downwards. Each person draws one, and if four play, those who choose the two highest are partners, against those who draw the two lowest; drawing the latter also serves to determine who is to lay down the first piece, which is reckoned a great advantage. Afterwards each player takes seven pieces at random. The eldest hand having laid down one, the next must pair him at either end of the piece he may choose, according to the number of pips or the blank in the compartment of the piece; but whenever any party cannot match the part, either of the domino last put down, or of that unpaired at the other end of the row, then the next is at liberty to play. Thus they play alternately, either until one party has played all his pieces, and thereby won the game, or till the game be blocked; that is, when neither party can play by matching the pieces when unpaired at either end, then that party wins who possesses the smallest number of pips on the pieces remaining. 
In playing this game it is to the advantage of the player to dispossess himself as early as possible of the heavy pieces, such as a double-six, five, four, &c. Sometimes when two persons play, they take each only seven pieces, and agree to play or draw, that is when one cannot come in or pair the pieces on the board at the end unmatched, he then is to draw from the fourteen pieces in stock till he find one to suit.

4). Code information

4.1). Rules applied

Even though there are some variations in the domino game rules, for this project, the following ones have been implemented:

A). There are two players;
B). There is one double six set (28 tiles);
C). The winner will be the player that eliminate all the pieces first or, in case the game is blocked, the one that has the smallest number of pips on the pieces remaining.

4.2). DOM and OOP

To organize the logic in javascript, the code will be organized using Object-oriented Programming and the elements will be manipulated using Document Object Model.
